# bash_scripting
This is a repo where I will upload my own scripts in bash. Below you will find a description of each of them

createpipenv.sh: This is a script that creates automatically a virtual enviroment with pipenv. I have several enviroments clasified in different
folders like "EnviromentForwebdeveloping/Pipfile"  so with this script, the only thing I have to do is to pass the location of the Pipfile and then the script will add the Pipfile to your project or enviroment folder and will set up the virtual enviroment according dependencies in the Pipfile.
